"""Description
Adam has a pyramid of numbers. The pyramid structure is formed by arranging the numbers in the following pattern

             1

           212

         32123

       4321234

     543212345

N____212____N

The first row contains the number 1. The second row contains the numbers 2, 1, and 2. The third row contains the numbers 3, 2, 1, 2, and 3. This pattern continues for subsequent rows, until it reaches N, which represents the height of the pyramid.

Given height of pyramid N find the sum of the numbers in the pyramid and return the sum as the output.

Sample Input:

3

Sample Output:

17
